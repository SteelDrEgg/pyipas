## About
This is just a command line tool for extract infos in ipa file. The operation is really anti-human, so I strongly recommand you to modify the souce code to adopt in your own project.

## Usage
It needs an output path, it should looks like this: `/some/path/dir`.

I'm too tired writting documents, so see `-h` or `-help` for more options.
